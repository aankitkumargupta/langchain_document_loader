Mentor: Welcome everyone! Today, we’ll be diving into Binary Trees in Python. Can anyone tell me what a binary tree is?

Student: It’s a tree data structure where each node has at most two children?

Mentor: Exactly! Those children are typically referred to as the left and right child. Let’s start with a basic example.

Mentor: In Python, we can define a node using a class. 

Mentor: example, This class defines a single node. To build a tree, we link nodes together.

Mentor: Now, what are some common operations we perform on binary trees?

Student: Searching, inserting, and traversing?

Mentor: Correct. Let’s talk about traversal methods. The three most common are inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal. Here’s how we define them recursively.

Mentor:
def inorder(root):
    if root:
        inorder(root.left)
        print(root.val)
        inorder(root.right)

Mentor: This will print the nodes in left-root-right order.

Student: Is inorder traversal the same as DFS?

Mentor: Great question! Inorder is one form of Depth-First Search (DFS), yes. But DFS also includes preorder and postorder.

Mentor: Now, suppose we want to check if a binary tree is balanced. A tree is balanced if the heights of two child subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

Mentor: Yes, it's an efficient recursive way to solve the problem. That wraps up our session. Before we finish, here’s a quick recap:

- Binary Trees have nodes with up to two children.
- We use traversals like inorder, preorder, and postorder.
- A balanced tree has nearly equal heights in its subtrees.

Mentor: Please review today’s notebook and submit the coding task before the next class. Thank you!
